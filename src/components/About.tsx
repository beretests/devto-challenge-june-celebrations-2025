          About Goat Cheese Day

        <Typography gutterBottom sx={{ textAlign: "justify", pb: 2 }}>
          Goat Cheese Day is a celebration of the delicious and diverse world of
          cheese made from goat's milk. Itâ€™s a time to recognize small farmers,
          cheesemakers, and food lovers who bring goat cheese to our tables.

        <Typography sx={{ textAlign: "justify", pb: 2 }}>
          Goat Cheese Day was initiated in 1998 by the American Cheese Society
          and the French goat cheese producer Bongrain (now Savencia Fromage &
          Dairy). They created it to raise awareness about the health, flavor,
          and sustainable advantages of goat cheese.{" "}
